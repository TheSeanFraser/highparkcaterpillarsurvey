## Session Start Times
As the season proceeds from mid-May through mid-October (start and end dates dependant on weather), the initial session start time is 9:15 PM - gradually becoming earlier starting in mid-summer as the sun starts to set earlier.



## You need to be

- available to do evening sessions (see session times below)
- able to walk up to 4 km per session on paved & unpaved surfaces (most sessions are 1-3 km)
