excerpt: "Caterpillars are a critical, and often overlooked, part of many ecosystems. Launched in the summer of 2020, the High Park Caterpillar Survey is a multi-year citizen science project (100-percent volunteer) documenting the diversity, abundance, and behaviour of caterpillars in Toronto's High Park."

As far as we know, this is the only citizen science project in North America (and possibly the world) focused exclusively on documenting the caterpillars of an urban park. If you know of any others, please let us know.

The survey welcomes new volunteers — no experience necessary. [You can find more details here.](/volunteer/)
