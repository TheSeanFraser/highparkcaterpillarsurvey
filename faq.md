## Is there a fee to join?

No, there is no fee to join the survey and everyone involved is a volunteer.

## Do you accept beginners?

Absolutely! All you need is a love of nature and a sense of adventure (think: treasure hunt). We will teach you what you need to know. Of course, we also welcome those with a biology or naturalist background.

## How many species of caterpillars have you found so far?

The list is constantly expanding. To see the current total, visit the home page and scroll down to the species counter.

## Do you find anything besides caterpillars?

Yes, lots of other things, including snails, slugs, millipedes, spiders, beetles, true bugs, cicadas, praying mantises, odonates (dragonflies & damselflies), fungi, lichens, mosses, and various parts of plants (leaves, flowers, fruits, etc.). We even found a snake once.

## Do I need any specialized equipment?

Ultraviolet (UV) flashlights are provided for use. We will also loan you a pair of UV safety glasses for your first two sessions. After that, you need to purchase your own (you can get a pair for $10-20). If you wear prescription eyeglasses, then you already have UV protection and won't require safety glasses.

## Why do the sessions take place at night?

The fluorescent light emitted when UV light is shined on caterpillars is weak and can be seen more easily in the dark, which is why sessions take place after sunset. The good news is that once late July rolls around, the days start getting shorter, allowing us to start and end the sessions earlier.

## Is the park safe after dark?

Over the years, we have held nearly 200 nighttime sessions and have never had any issues.
