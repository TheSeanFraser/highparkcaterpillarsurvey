While a number of techniques exist for finding caterpillars, we have found the following three best suit our needs.

## 1. UV flashlights

Our main method is to go out after sunset, ultraviolet (UV) flashlights in hand, in search of caterpillars that fluoresce. Many caterpillar species fluoresce when UV light is shined on them and this fluorescence is much easier to see in the dark.

## 2. Visual searches

On occasion, we do daytime sessions to search for caterpillars that feed on or within leaves (the latter are called leaf miners) or other plant parts, or that manipulate leaves in various ways to create shelters (leaf rollers/folders/tiers). On rare occasion, we have found caterpillars that feed on substrates such as fungi.

## 3. Beating sheet

From time to time we sample vegetation using a beating sheet, either during the daytime or after sunset.
