A typical night session for the High Park Caterpillar Survey looks something like this: <!--more-->
- Chat for a few minutes at the meeting spot while waiting for everyone to arrive.
- UV flashlights are distributed.
- Target area(s) of the park are discussed.
- Roles are assigned ("Time Keeper", etc.).
- The search begins!
- Caterpillars are found and observed by the group while walking through the target area.
- "Time Keeper" lets the group know when to start heading back to the meeting spot.
- Discuss the night's findings while returning the UV flashlights.
