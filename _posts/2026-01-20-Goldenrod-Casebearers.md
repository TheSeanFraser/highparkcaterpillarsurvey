After collecting goldenrod for rearing another species, Richard noticed there was something moving along the flowers. Upon closer inspection, a larva carrying a case was found to be using the plant as a host. Some research determined that these were part of the *Coleophora duplicis* complex - a collection of goldenrod casebearer moths that have been understudied and are currently impossible to identify without DNA analysis.


After subsequent searches, these goldenrod casebearers were found in many (possibly a majority) of patches of goldenrod around High Park. Other members of the survey have reported them in other parks around Toronto. What was once overlooked has now been seen all over the place - a familiar theme for our efforts.

Here is an [iNaturalist observation](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/322207444) for this group.
